Absolutely! This is a solid and ambitious project — you're essentially building a high-throughput, fault-tolerant, real-time analytics backend for video ad tracking in Go.

Let’s break it down into parts so we can discuss design choices, implementation strategies, and tech stack for each. We can go over each of these and iterate as needed:

🧱 1. System Design Overview
You're looking for a high-concurrency, low-latency, resilient system. A possible design structure:

API layer (Golang HTTP handlers)

Async processing layer (channel-based worker pool or queue-based like Kafka/NATS)

Storage layer (PostgreSQL, Redis, or both)

Analytics engine (cache + time-windowed aggregations)

Monitoring & logging

🔌 2. API Endpoints
GET /ads
Fetch all ad metadata.

Simple PostgreSQL or in-memory cache (e.g., Redis) lookup.

POST /ads/click
Accept Ad ID, timestamp, IP, video playback time.

Do not block: Immediately acknowledge then send the click to an async queue or worker pool.

go
Copy
Edit
type ClickEvent struct {
    AdID            string
    Timestamp       time.Time
    IP              string
    PlaybackSeconds int
}
Strategy:
Push to an in-memory channel or publish to message queue (Kafka/NATS/Redis Streams).

Workers pick and store into DB/retry buffer.

GET /ads/analytics
Real-time/near real-time metrics like:

Total clicks

CTR

Clicks in last N minutes

Use Redis time-series buckets for fast aggregation + fall back to PostgreSQL for accuracy if needed.

📦 3. Data Layer
PostgreSQL:

Store ads and click logs.

Use bulk inserts with retry on failure.

Redis:

Track real-time metrics (ZADD or INCR with TTL).

Backup Buffer:

If PostgreSQL goes down, click events are stored in an on-disk buffer (e.g., BoltDB or just file) and retried.

🔄 4. Asynchronous Processing
Options:

Option A: Channel-based workers

Simple, works well for moderate scale.

Option B: Message queue (e.g., Kafka, NATS)

Better at scale + retries + replay.

📊 5. Real-Time Analytics Engine
Store recent clicks per ad in Redis:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
Key: ad:{ad_id}:clicks
Value: ZSET of timestamps
To calculate:

Clicks in last 5 minutes → ZRANGEBYSCORE key now-300 now

CTR → Total clicks / impressions

Or use:

RedisTimeSeries

In-memory + sync every N seconds to persistent DB

🛠️ 6. Production Readiness
Docker:

Dockerfile to build Go binary + run server.

Compose to start Redis/PostgreSQL locally.

.env:

For DB connection, ports, queue URLs.

Structured logging:

Use logrus or zap.

Prometheus metrics:

Expose /metrics with goroutine counts, QPS, errors, etc.

🚀 7. Scalability and Resilience
Concurrency:

Goroutines for each HTTP request + worker pool for processing.

Mutex/maps or sync.Map for temporary in-memory data.

Partial failure:

Retry queue if DB is down.

Dead letter queue for invalid events.

✅ 8. Bonus Features
Kubernetes deployment:

Add Helm chart + readiness probes.

Advanced analytics:

Clicks per hour/day via SQL or Redis aggregation.

CI/CD:

GitHub Actions: run tests, build image, push to Docker Hub.

📂 9. Project Structure
bash

/cmd
  /server         // Entry point
/internal
  /handlers       // API handlers
  /models         // DB models
  /queue          // Event queue logic
  /analytics      // Real-time computation
  /utils          // Logging, config
/config
  config.go       // env config
/Dockerfile
/docker-compose.yml
🔎 Let's Collaborate
Let me know:

Do you want to use PostgreSQL + Redis or a message queue like Kafka too?

Should we go with in-memory channels or actual message queues?

Want to start with a basic version and build incrementally?

How soon are you planning to deploy this?

Ready to get started? I can scaffold the base structure for you.

🔧 Component Breakdown
1. Client → API Gateway/Load Balancer
Handles traffic spikes and routes requests to your Go API server.

NGINX, AWS ALB, or GCP Load Balancer.

2. GoLang API Server
Handles HTTP requests:

GET /ads – Reads ad metadata from PostgreSQL or Redis cache.

POST /ads/click – Accepts click data, validates, and pushes to queue.

GET /ads/analytics – Returns real-time metrics from Redis.

Fast response to client: POST /ads/click just validates & offloads to queue (non-blocking).

3. Queue (Kafka / NATS / Redis Streams)
Click events are offloaded to the queue.

Benefits:

Asynchronous processing.

Retry on failure.

Smooth handling of spikes.

Decouples request from processing.

4. Worker Pool (Go Routines or Separate Go Service)
Listens to queue.

Processes click events:

Inserts into PostgreSQL for durability.

Updates Redis time-series cache for real-time analytics.

Has retry logic or offloads failed jobs to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).

5. PostgreSQL
Durable storage of:

Ad metadata

Raw click logs (for analytics, compliance, etc.)

6. Redis
Real-time cache and counter store

Keeps:

Clicks per ad in past X mins (using ZSET or RedisTimeSeries)

Aggregate metrics (CTR, impressions)

Time-based TTL to avoid memory bloat.

7. Dead Letter Queue (Optional but Recommended)
Failed events from workers go here.

You can replay or inspect later.

8. Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana + Logs)
Expose /metrics for:

Throughput

Queue length

Error rate

Request latency

Use zap or logrus for structured logs.

9. DevOps:
Docker:

Go service, Redis, PostgreSQL, Kafka in docker-compose.yml.

CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI):

Linting, tests, Docker build & push.

Kubernetes (optional):

Scalable pods for API + workers.

HPA for traffic spikes.
